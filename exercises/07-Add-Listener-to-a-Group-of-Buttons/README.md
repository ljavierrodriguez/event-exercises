The great thing about the addEventListener function is that you can add it during runtime.

Instructions
During runtime, using javascript, add a click event listener for every button on the website, and alert "hello" when any 
of them is clicked

Hint
-Use the .getElementsByTagName function
- loop through all the button elements adding the event listener
